Wow, okay, just wow. Fountain of Youth. Man, I'm still processing. Like what even just happened in there? The theater was a friggin' jungle, people chomping on popcorn like they're savages, crumbs everywhere. Felt like I was sittin' on a popcorn mattress. My back is screaming murder right now. The movie though... It's this swirling whirlpool of colors, and plots... sorta like when you're just waking up from a dream that kind of stickily lingers.

> This one scene — there's a guy on a horse, right? And he's galloping through this CGI jungle, chasing after his past self or something impossible, those glossy beautiful digital leaves swirling around him like confetti. I think it was supposed to be symbolic of time or destiny? But I'm just like dude, you need to check your horse for worms, ya know? Like, this horse looks majestic, but come on, in my line of work, you see beyond the shimmery coat.

And, there’s this weird moment where a fountain almost starts speaking? I can’t even remember the voice because the guy next to me decides now's the perfect time to rustle through his Skittles. Dude, pick a color and commit. But oh well, the fountain babbles on about eternity and I’m trying not to laugh because it reminds me of that client with a parrot that mimics people's laughs. Imagine eternity in parrot voice — nightmare fuel.

I think someone told me to download the movie, but honestly, just go watch the movie. If you can, use those fancy seats that let you stretch out, my back's an audible reminder of this mistake.

> There's a scene with a tea ceremony or a ritual — couldn't tell, 'cause why was everyone whispering? It looked serene, though. Yet all I could think about was if they have some ancient cat lurking around like those from ancient poems. Does it watch and judge in feline omnipotence? Doesn't matter, I guess, but fun to think about.

Every plot twist felt like watching a Labrador attempting an obstacle course — charming, chaotic, slightly predictable. I mean, who didn’t see that twist about the time-traveling fish coming? But then, it goes all Rescue Rangers, you half-expect this ensemble to sprout fur and start singing.

So, not sure if it's the movie that's an enigma or my brain unraveling like those pretzels you get at the concession stand.

```C++
int main() {
    // What was I going to type here?
    if (suddenRealization) {
        downloadMovie();  // Nope, that's not right.
    }
    return journeyThroughTime;
}
```

If you see it, maybe carry a chiropractor with you, just sayin'.
